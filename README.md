# COMP177 Web Server Project

This project focuses on the development of a web server application. The server is designed to receive requests from clients and display the content of the received text request on the screen. To enhance its functionality, the server incorporates the use of argparse, allowing for command-line arguments to be provided, including the specification of the port number.
