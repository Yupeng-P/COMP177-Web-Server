# Messaging Client Project

This project focuses to develop a client-side messaging system that enables users to communicate with each other through a server.

Upon running the program, the client establishes a connection with the server. The initial exchange involves a greeting message from the client and a corresponding response from the server. The client is then prompted to provide a username and password for authentication. The credentials are sent to the server for validation, ensuring that only authorized users can access the messaging system.
